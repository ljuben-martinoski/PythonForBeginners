"""This module demonstrates the use of ternary operators in Python.
A ternary operator allows for a compact syntax to assign a value based on a condition.
It is a one-liner replacement for the traditional if-else statement.
    """


age = 15  # Example age value

if age < 18:  # checking if age is less than 18
    print("You are a minor.")  # if condition is true this block will be executed
else:
    message = "Not a minor."

print(message)  # print the message variable

"""Here is a small workout for you to practice ternary operators.
1. Create a variable called score and assign it a value.
2. Use a ternary operator to assign a variable grade with the value "Pass" if score is 50 or more, and "Fail" otherwise.
3. Print the grade variable to the console.
4. Test your code with different score values to see the output change.
5. Additionally, create a variable named status that uses a ternary operator to assign "Adult" if age is 18 or older, and "Minor" otherwise. Print the status variable as well.
